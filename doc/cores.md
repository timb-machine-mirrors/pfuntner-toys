# `cores`

## Purpose
Summarizes output from the Linux `lscpu` command. I must confess that I don't often think of using this one but I probably need to get more into the habit of using it. I'm not crazy about the name `cores` - I wonder if `cpus` would be easier for me to remember, etc.

## Syntax
```
Syntax: cores
```

### Options and arguments
There are no options or arguments

## Example

```
$ cores
CPU(s): 4
Core(s) per socket: 2
8
$
```

## Notes

- It likely won't work well from Windoze - perhaps it would work if you use [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com).  Personally, cygwin is a requirement on Windoze!
