# Bruno's Toys
This is a collection of Unix tools command line that make my life easier.  I think others might like them too so I'm making them available here but the repository is just a nice way for me to keep track of changes and deploy them easily to systems.

I will admit that the documentation is rather poor for some of the tools and many of them have little or **no** comments.  This is a work in progress - I'm constantly creating new tools and improving documentation.  In November 2017, I did a major overhaul of the documentation because I was disatisfed with having a huge table.  I'm liking the results so far.

If you have questions, problems, etc, you can reach me at <img src="images/email.jpg" />.

### Unix platforms

Over the years, I've used man different _Unix_ platforms: Redhat, Suse, Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, Z/OS, Cygwin, Git bash, etc.  I owe no allegiance to any single platform and consider them all pretty much equal as long as they behave similarly.  I have seen some issues using my tools (and other commands!) from Git bash on Windoze and sometimes a tool was only designed to work on specific platforms - I'll try to put such stuff on the doc page for the tool.  In general if I find a platform where one of my tools doesn't work well, I will try to fix it!

## The much-heralded TOOLS

Select a tool below to learn more about it.  I use _Bruno's Favorite_ to indicate that a tool is:
- very useful and practical
- personally used by me a few times a week if not at least once a day!
