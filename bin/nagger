   Print random strings while sleeping between each line.  This can be used
   to see if an I/O stream is being buffered.  If something is reading the
   output stream and doesn't seem single lines produced every few seconds,
   one (or both?) of the streams is being buffered and data probably won't
   be delivered until the buffer is full.
